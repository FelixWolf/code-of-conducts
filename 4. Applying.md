# Applying your Code of Conduct to your community
This is about introducing, enforcing is covered in the next document.

## Bring forth the proposal
Don't just throw it onto your project or community, this can make it seem that 
you do not want the input of your community. Instead, ask for any input. If 
what you are proposing already had input, ensure no one has any final words to 
say about it before adding it.

## Acknowledge issues and concerns
A code of conduct is a major change to a community, expect people to raise 
concerns about it. Don't shrug these off or attack people who have concerns or 
doubts about it. Instead, try to understand what they are concerned about.

If a member is concerned about enforcement of something that isn't going to 
happen, try to understand why they think it will be enforced. Perhaps additional
 wording in the code of conduct could help. Alternatively you can ensure the 
contributor that it will not happen.
 
If a member is concerned about enforcement of something that is written, see if 
you can reach a middle ground or agreement.

## Don't enforce the conduct on stuff that happened before it was made official
Doing this can be seen as spiteful and harmful to the community. Understand 
that the past is the past, people do change. By enforcing rules on something 
that was said when there was no explicit rule can leave a bad taste for the 
code of conduct, and can cause people to leave.
