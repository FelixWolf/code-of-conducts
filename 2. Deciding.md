# Do I need a Code of Conduct?
It is often thought that every project needs a code of conduct, this isn't 
true. You should use your best judgement on deciding if your project needs one, 
and if the project is big enough, consider asking how the community feels about 
one.

Here are some questions to help decide if your project needs one:
## Have there been issues inside the project before?
If you have contributors who have caused issues before, it may be a sign that 
some ground rules need to be set forth.

## Is your project big enough?
If your project is just a bunch of friends, you very likely do not need one. 
If your project is just you, you won't be causing issues with yourself, and 
adding a code of conduct would likely just clutter the commit log.

## Is a code of conduct right for your *community*?
You may think a code of conduct is right for your project, but a major question 
that is needed to be asked, is it right for your community? If your project is 
designed around a philosphy of goofing off, it is very unlikely needed as a 
code of conduct can greatly impact the existing philosphy.

## Most importantly, Do you trust your community?
Adding a Code of Conduct can be interpretted in various ways. The 
interpretation can very from person to person. This can be interpretted as 
"Adding a Code of Conduct means to protect and better the community.", 
just as much as it can be interpretted as 
"I don't trust the community.".

It is highly important to not just throw one out there just because Github says 
to do so. Blindly doing so can send the wrong message, especially if you don't 
consult the community first.

If you don't think a code of conduct is right for your community, you have two 
options:
1. Don't change anything.
2. Use the "No code of conduct" template: https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC
