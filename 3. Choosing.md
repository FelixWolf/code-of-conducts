# Choosing a Code of Conduct
Choosing the right Code of Conduct can be difficult. You can either go with a 
"cookie cutter" solution, which is a premade conduct, or write your own. With 
both options, it doesn't only decide what type of community you want, but 
also decide if your community will divide it's self.

Keep these key values in mind:

## The simpler, the better.
Don't go overboard with what the conduct says, be simple and direct. Ensure 
that there is no room for incorrect interpretation.

## Avoid politics at all cost
In the current climate, politics can divide a project. Dividing a project can 
mean either loosing contributors, or breaking off into two seperate projects. 
Not only does this mean loss in productivity, but loss in community.

# GOOD code of conducts:
Not all of these have licenses avaliable. If you wish to just copy/paste what 
they have, you may need to consult a project director to figure out a license 
or to obtain permission to use them:

## Blender Foundation Code of Conduct (Unknown license)
URL: https://wiki.blender.org/w/index.php?title=Contact/CodeOfConduct&oldid=12894

Blender Foundation's Code of Conduct provides some great key values on what 
makes a great code of conduct:
1. Understanding mistakes happen
2. Understanding misunderstandings happen
3. Understanding disagreements happen and it is acceptable to "Agree to disagree".

## OpenSSL Code of Conduct (Unknown license)
URL: https://www.openssl.org/community/conduct.html

OpenSSL's Code of Conduct doesn't waste time with long winded text and instead 
gets straight to the point:
1. Doesn't care what someone's identity is
2. Don't harass or be abusive to people
3. Code should be judged by it's content, not it's author.

## The **ORIGINAL** Python Software Foundation Conduct (Public Domain)

PSF's *ORIGINAL* code of conduct has three key values which make both reading 
 it and understanding it extremely simple:
1. Be open
2. Be considerate
3. Be respectful

# Examples of BAD conducts:
Bad code of conducts can make people feel unsafe, here are some examples and why:

## Contributor Covenant
URL: <span>https://www.contributor-covenant.org/</span>

Contributor Covenant has not only divided communities, but has been abused 
multiple times, and it's abuse is encouraged by it's creator. Additionally, it 
violates one of the core values of a "Good" code of conduct, that being, it is 
explicitly stated to be a political document.

1. Encouragement of abuse by it's author ([Source](https:/twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041465346656530432), [Archive 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20190711145602/https:/twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041465346656530432), [Archive 2](https://archive.ph/uAzAC))
2. Statement that it is designed to be political ([Source](https:/twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041465346656530432), [Archive 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20190711145602/https:/twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041465346656530432), [Archive 2](https://archive.ph/uAzAC))
3. Abused multiple times
4. Author intends it to destroy projects rather than help ([Source](https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041441155874009093), [Archive 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20190711145600/https:/twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1041441155874009093), [Archive 2](https://archive.ph/E1tTo))

## Geek Feminism's Code of Conduct
URL <span>https://geekfeminismdotorg.wordpress.com/about/code-of-conduct/</span>

Geek Feminism's code of conduct is often cited as a reference rather than used, 
however it violate's it's self, as well as makes exceptions to racism and 
sexism, among other things:

1. No scope, this technically can be applied to any contributor for any reason,
 even outside the project.
2. Explicit exclusion to the rules to be racist, sexist, or otherwise abusive to
 those it considers to be "priviliged" as it isn't possible to do so.
3. Encouraging harmful communication practices such as allowing contributors to 
 shut other contributors out just because they want to, or allowing contributors
 to refuse to explain why something caused issue with them.

## Otter Tech variants
URL <span>https://github.com/sagesharp/code-of-conduct-template/</span>

While some resulting Code of Conducts can be acceptable, they explicitly push 
for the "reversisms" clause seen in Geek Feminism's Code of Conduct, as well as 
explicitly making "political affiliation" a "red flag" of protected classes. 
Code of Conducts that don't enforce political affiliation can delve cause 
debates, as well as make some people feel uncomfortable or "at risk" due to 
their opinions or beliefs. Additionally people may use the lack of enforcement 
to try and get someone to violate the conduct indirectly.

While not all resulting code of conducts from Otter Tech may constitue the 
following rulings, their advocacy for and pushing for these cause enough 
concern to be listed:
1. Explicit exclusion to the rules to be racist, sexist, or otherwise abusive to
 those it considers to be "priviliged" as it isn't possible to do so.
2. Encouraging harmful communication practices such as allowing contributors to 
 shut other contributors out just because they want to, or allowing contributors
 to refuse to explain why something caused issue with them.
3. Discouragement of political affiliation protection which can cause problems 
 for any political side, creating ability for biased enforcement, or encouraging
 contributors to attempt to argue with others to get others to violate the 
 code of conduct.
