# Overview
Code of Conducts have existed for quite some time, but gained traction around 
2016, and went mainstream in 2018 when Github added the "Add a code of conduct" 
feature.

## What does a Code of Conduct do
A Code of Conduct is *intended* to help protect the project and it's community, 
However depending on which you choose, this can very greatly.

Most Code of Conducts will simply say to be nice and play nice, and typically 
that is what one expects, however this isn't true for some.

It is HIGHLY important to make clear where the Code of Conduct applies, and lay 
down enforcement rules.

## What a Code of Conduct **SHOULDN'T** do
A code of conduct is designed to make people feel safe, but some that this 
project aims to address, can have the opposite effect.

A Code of Conduct should never:
1. Police a user's social media unless they are directly representing a project
2. Make someone feel unsafe
3. Cause conflict inside the project or community

I could add more, but I want to keep that list as simple as possible.

## Why policing a user's social media is a bad thing
One may think that a user's social media is a good descriptor of how they will 
interact with a project, but this is far from the truth.

Many people who contribute to projects come to just contribute to the project, 
99% of the time, they will leave their politics at the door unless someone 
initates a political discussion. Such discussions can easily divide and cause 
havock requiring administrative action(such as locking threads or suspending 
contributors temporarily).

## Not having a Code of Conduct doesn't mean "No rules"
Often people will think no code of conduct means no rules. When there is none, 
the rules are based around the community and what the community has come to 
expect from one and other. This typically means "Be nice".
